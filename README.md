# Tools
I used R for the data scraping, cleaning and formatting. The essay is built with D3.js on a graphics rig heavily inspired by [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/).

The episode transcriptions are stored in a MongoDB Atlas database and accessed via a Heroku application.




# Methodology
The transcription data for this story was scraped from the [Critical Role Wiki](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Transcripts). I grouped all non-core cast members and multi-person lines as ‘other’ and standardized the names used. I only included dialogue from after the opening theme.
